# Database Design
================

## Overview

This document describes the database design for the billing system. The database is designed to store information about customers, products, billings, and billing items.

## Entity Relationship Diagram

The following entity relationship diagram (ERD) shows the relationships between the different entities in the database:


## Tables

### Customers

* `id`: unique identifier for each customer (primary key)
* `name`: name of the customer
* `email`: email address of the customer
* `address`: address of the customer

### Products

* `id`: unique identifier for each product (primary key)
* `name`: name of the product
* `description`: description of the product
* `price`: price of the product

### Billings

* `id`: unique identifier for each billing (primary key)
* `customer_id`: foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `Customers` table
* `date`: date of the billing
* `total_amount`: total amount of the billing
* `status`: status of the billing (e.g. pending, paid, cancelled)

### Billing_Items

* `id`: unique identifier for each billing item (primary key)
* `billing_id`: foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `Billings` table
* `product_id`: foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `Products` table
* `quantity`: quantity of the product purchased
* `unit_price`: unit price of the product
* `total_price`: total price of the product (quantity x unit_price)

## Indexes

* Create an index on the `customer_id` column in the `Billings` table to improve query performance.
* Create an index on the `product_id` column in the `Billing_Items` table to improve query performance.
* Create an index on the `billing_id` column in the `Billing_Items` table to improve query performance.

## Partitioning

* Partition the `Billings` and `Billing_Items` tables by date to improve query performance and reduce storage costs.

## Scalability

* Use a distributed database system to scale the database horizontally.
* Use load balancing and connection pooling to distribute the workload across multiple database servers.

## Backup and Recovery

* Implement a regular backup schedule to ensure that billing data is safely stored.
* Implement a disaster recovery plan to ensure that the database can be restored in case of a failure.
